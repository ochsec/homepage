To whom it may concern,

I am a full-stack engineer specializing in Node.js Web APIs and microservices with six years industry experience designing and developing solutions in SQL, .NET, Express.js and Angular. I have created web services in the healthcare industry utilizing Node.js to deliver oncology images to the world's largest pharmaceutical clients (i.e. Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca), to interface LIMS with laboratory instruments, and have built client web applications in conjuction with SPA frameworks including Angular & ExtJS. I have used SQL and ORMs extensively, developed two applications with Mongodb, utilized the AWS Node.js SDKs and am knowleadgeable of websockets, asynchronous programming, Typescript, node package development, web frameworks and many topics related to Node.js development. In addition to Typescript, I have developed in C# for several years and pushed Python scripts to production. My colleagues would say I am the go-to guy for creative problem solving and am always bringing new ideas to the table, as well as reliable in getting the project done and to specifications.

Best regards,   
Christopher Ochsenreither
